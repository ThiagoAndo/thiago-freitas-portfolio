I am proud to have a unique background that combines system engineering, computer networking, and software development. In my various roles, I have found myself regularly called upon to tackle technical challenges, resolve coding issues and engage with different teams working on different projects. My love of coding drives me internally and I relish every opportunity to tackle the deepest technical challenges. From developing a user-friendly frontend to building reliable web servers, I've worked on many projects. Also, have experience with cross-platform mobile application development.
