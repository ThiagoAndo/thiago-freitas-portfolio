I'm enthusiastic about tech, coding, and learning new things about computers and what they can do. I've been dabbling with coding since roughly the age of 15 until I started studying computer science at the university at 19, where my interest really peaked. Take a peek at the projects I have done, or jump straight to my github. When I have time I sometimes contributing to open source projects and answer questions in forums and help people with code.

Other than coding I enjoy tinkering with computers and my homelab, as of now includes an old PC running Raid 1 TrueNAS and a Raspberry Pi 3 running Pi-hole and PiVPN. I also love to attended hackathons where people and code meet together to solve solutions in a hastly manner
